        My name is Rahul Singh and I am a student in the CIT program at BCIT. 
        Previously I have completed a <em>BA in Cognitive Systems at UBC </em> 
        and I figured I would use this pandemic downtime to brush up on my tech 
        skills. An interesting fact about me is that I regularly use a 
        <strong>Dvorak</strong> layout on my keyboard.
