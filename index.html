            My name is Rahul Singh and I am a student in the CIT program at BCIT. Previously I have completed a <em>BA in Cognitive Systems at UBC </em> and I figured I would use this 
            pandemic downtime to brush up on my tech skills. An interesting fact about me is that I regularly use a <strong>Dvorak</strong> layout on my keyboard.
